# Docker Security Fixes Applied

## Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 1. MongoDB Authentication
**Issue**: MongoDB was running without authentication (`--noauth`)
**Fix**: 
- Added MongoDB root user/password authentication
- Updated connection strings to use authenticated connections
- Environment variable: `MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=mongoSecurePassword123`

### 2. Removed Hard-coded Secrets
**Issue**: JWT secrets and encryption keys were exposed in docker-compose.yml
**Fix**:
- Moved all sensitive variables to .env file
- Added `env_file: - .env` to compose services
- Removed hard-coded CREDS_KEY, JWT_SECRET, etc.

### 3. Enhanced Security Headers (nginx)
**Issue**: Missing security headers and rate limiting
**Fix**:
- Added security headers: X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, CSP, etc.
- Implemented rate limiting for API and login endpoints
- Added proper proxy headers for security
- Enabled gzip compression

### 4. Container Security
**Issue**: No resource limits or security constraints
**Fix**:
- Added resource limits (memory/CPU) to all services
- Implemented security_opt: no-new-privileges
- Added health checks for all services
- Enhanced logging configuration

### 5. Environment Configuration
**Issue**: Inconsistent environment variables across files
**Fix**:
- Standardized MongoDB connection strings
- Fixed APP_TITLE to use nxsGPT consistently
- Aligned container names and database names

## Security Improvements Added

### Resource Limits
- API: 2GB memory, 1 CPU limit
- MongoDB: 1GB memory, 0.5 CPU limit  
- MeiliSearch: 512MB memory, 0.5 CPU limit
- VectorDB: 512MB memory, 0.5 CPU limit
- RAG API: 1GB memory, 0.5 CPU limit

### Health Checks
All services now have health checks with:
- 30s intervals
- 10s timeout
- Proper retry logic
- Startup grace periods

### Network Security
- Restricted bridge network configuration
- Host binding to localhost only
- Inter-container communication properly configured

### Logging Security
- JSON file logging with rotation
- Maximum 10MB per log file
- Keep only 3 log files
- Prevents log disk exhaustion

## Files Modified

1. `docker-compose.yml` - Removed hard-coded secrets, added env_file
2. `deploy-compose.yml` - Fixed MongoDB authentication, updated MONGO_URI
3. `docker-compose.override.yml` - Added comprehensive security overrides
4. `.env` - Updated with secure MongoDB credentials and nxsGPT branding
5. `client/nginx.conf` - Enhanced with security headers and rate limiting

## Post-Fix Actions Required

1. **Change Default Passwords**: Update MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD to a strong password
2. **SSL/TLS**: Configure SSL certificates for production
3. **Secrets Management**: Consider using Docker secrets for production
4. **Monitoring**: Implement health check monitoring and alerting
5. **Backup Strategy**: Ensure MongoDB data volumes are backed up

## Verification Steps

1. Stop existing containers: `docker-compose down`
2. Rebuild with security fixes: `docker-compose build --no-cache`
3. Start with overrides: `docker-compose up -d`
4. Verify health checks: `docker-compose ps`
5. Check logs: `docker-compose logs -f`

## Security Best Practices Applied

- ✅ Authentication enabled on all databases
- ✅ No hard-coded secrets in configuration
- ✅ Resource limits prevent DoS attacks
- ✅ Security headers protect against XSS/CSRF
- ✅ Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- ✅ Health checks enable monitoring
- ✅ Proper logging with rotation
- ✅ Network isolation and security
- ✅ Container privilege restrictions

## Next Steps

The research process is ongoing to gather additional best practices and identify any remaining configuration issues. The security fixes applied address the most critical vulnerabilities identified in the initial analysis.
